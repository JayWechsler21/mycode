#Collect IP:address information from a user, and display it back to them.

##Colect input from the user
user_input = input('Please enter an IPv4 IP address:')

##Print out the input collected from the user
print("You told me the IPv4 address is:" + user_input)


##The first line should collect and store input from the user. Ask the user for the ‘vendor name’ associated with the device. Use any variable name you would like.
##Use a second line of code to print the input you just collected from the user.

##Ask the user for the vendor name
vendor_name= input('vendor name')
